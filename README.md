# CuraTempTowerHelper

Description: Cura plugin that supports setting up temp-towers.

CAUTION: The plugin is still under "Work in Progress" state. 

Known Issues: The starting temperature has to be setup in the printing parameters. The temperatur changes from the plugin are working from the first layer change on after the initial temperature block.

The plugin should be located in the plugin directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.5\plugins\PostProcessingPlugin\scripts\TempTowerHelper.py )

The plugin was tested with Cura 4.5 and was working except of the initial temperature setting. It should also be compatible with cura versions > Cura 4.0
